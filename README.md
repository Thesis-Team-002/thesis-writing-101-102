# Web-Based Disaster Relief Assistance and Monitoring System for Affected Communities

Philippines faces frequent typhoons and disasters, and the relief distribution is often uncoordinated, slow and lacks transparency. Our solution is a centralized system for disaster management, where we can monitor the relief distribution of the affected families

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting** - The system shows live updates on relief operations.
Admins can see which areas have received help.
- **Track Donations and Relief Distribution** - The system records and monitors all donations and relief goods.
It keeps track of what is received and where it is delivered,
making the process organized, fair, and transparent.
- **List of the affected families and their needs** - Shows a list of the affected families and what they need.
